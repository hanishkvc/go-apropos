Go Apropos

Notes
#######

go doc requires one to already know the standard package to look for,
to get info about the same. However if one doesnt know which package
may contain what they want, they will have to grep the src directory
or do a web search.

This provides something like the apropos command wrt man pages, but
here it searchs for exported symbols from among all the packages in
the go source directory, which contains the specified token as part
of itself.

By default it uses 1st directory under /usr/share or /usr/local/share
which matchs the pattern "go-*" as the go source directory wrt packages
to search for. If required one can explicitly set the source directory
by using the cmdline arg

	goapropos --basepath <base_path> search_token

One can specify the token to use to match / search for symbols in
packages by using either the cmdline arg --find or by just specifing
it in the cmdline ie.

	goapropos --find search_token

	OR

	goapropos search_token

If one wants the logic to use both internal and exported symbols of the
packages when trying to find a match, one needs to specify the cmdline
argument --all, else the logic will try to match only exported symbols

	goapropos --all search_token

To get all the exported symbols of all the packages, use

	goapropos --find ""
